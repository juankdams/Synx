Synx
====

The whole Syn project (eclipse workspace).
This represents about 10 months of work / research / aknowledgment.
Thank you Ankama for creating such great games.

Bleh.

## Setup:
Download this piece of junk and choose it as workspace at eclipse startup.
As far as I remember, all libraries links should be done with vars 
so you just have to change the 'zLIBS' var to wherever you put your libs
Other than that, it should be pretty easy to setup.
You have all the sql database files needed in Syn/Syn_data, each representing an individual database.

## Running Syn:
Make sure the configurations under Syn/config.xml are allright.
Then open the Syn project under the 'Main' Working Set and run Core/Syn.
The projects Synaw and Synod are there only as source projects holders; they contain strategy-specific source code (relative to the game client used)
Syn compiles Synaw & Synod within itself so you don't have to worry about them.


## Also:
Sorry for all the stuff that is left undone by now.
I don't have much time nor much money and time is money so yeah, but at the moment, 
I'm excited about coding the Wakfu part of the emulator so the dofus part 
is gonna have to wait a little longer unless someone wants to throw some help in.
Also sorry if you see some retard comments or other stupidities of the genre.
It's not supposed to be the cleanest, I'm a human, please.
The Java JDK version used is 1.6.0_45

## Also also:
The threading packages under "NewThreads" suck, like many other things I've coded, no need to bash me about it.
Criticize as much as you want as long as it is constructive, otherwise you can stfu.
It would be nice to have some feedback, although I'm almost 99% sure I won't, but anyways.
